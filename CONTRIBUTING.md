## Contributing

We welcome all contributions, typo corrections, and general feedback.

**We ask that you submit PRs containing only changes only within the `_site` subdirectory.** This means to edit the Markdown (`.md`) files, not the built HTML. Someone from the Truffle team, when accepting the PR, will run the compilation step and update the HTML. Thank you!
